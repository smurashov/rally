    """Scenario runner that launches benchmark scenarios periodically.

    "Periodically" means that the scenario method is executed with intervals
    between two consecutive runs, specified in seconds in the input config
    (this period time doesn't depend on the scenario execution time).
    Each execution is a single benchmark scenario iteration (i.e. no parallel
    execution of multiple iterations is performed). The scenario will be
    launched for a fixed number of times in total (specified in the config).

    An example of a periodic scenario is booting 1 VM every 2 seconds. This
    execution type is thus very helpful in understanding the maximal load that
    a certain cloud can handle.
